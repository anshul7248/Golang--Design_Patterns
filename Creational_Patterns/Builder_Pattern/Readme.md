Builder Design Pattern is used when we need to create complex functions step by step.
Instead of having large functions with many parameters, we use builder to create the 
functions in a more readable way

Let say we are creating a car with different properties like brand, model, color or engineType.
Instead of using a large function with multiple parameter we are breaking it into smaller functions 
and making a Car.
